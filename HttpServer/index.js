// Certainly! The code you provided is a simple Node.js script that creates a basic HTTP server using the built-in http module. This server listens on port 3500 of the localhost (127.0.0.1) and responds to incoming HTTP requests with a simple text message.




// Importing the http Module:
// The script starts by importing the http module, which is a core module in Node.js that provides functionality for creating HTTP servers and clients.
const http = require("http")


// Creating the HTTP Server:
// The http.createServer() method is used to create an instance of an HTTP server. This method takes a callback function that will be executed every time an HTTP request is received. The callback function has two parameters: req (the request object) and res (the response object).
const server =  http.createServer((req , res)=>{
// Handling Requests:
// Inside the callback function, res.end() is used to send a response back to the client. In this case, the server responds with the message "Hello I am from the Other Side".
    res.end("Hello Iam from Other Sideniam subrat  ")
});


// Listening to the Server:
// The server.listen() method is used to start the server and make it listen on a specific port and hostname. In this case, it's set to listen on port 3500 and the hostname 127.0.0.1 (localhost). The method also takes a callback function that will be executed once the server is listening.

server.listen(3500 , "127.0.0.1" , ()=>{
// Console Output:
// When the server is successfully started and listening, the callback function provided to server.listen() is executed, and "Listening on port 3500" is printed to the console.
    console.log("listening the port number is  3500")
})
